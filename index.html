          <p id="info">Diego Maradona was more than just a footballer — he was a phenomenon, a force of nature who transcended sport. With a ball at his feet, he defied logic and gravity, painting moments of magic that left the world in awe. From the streets of Villa Fiorito to the world’s biggest stages, he carried the dreams of millions, inspiring with his passion, flair, and unshakable will.</p>
          <p id="info">His “Hand of God” and the “Goal of the Century” at the 1986 World Cup captured the paradox of Maradona: controversial yet divine, flawed yet brilliant. He was a symbol of resistance, of pride, of art in motion.</p>
          <p id="info">Though he has left this world, his legacy is immortal. Diego lives on in every child who dreams with a ball at their feet and in every roar of the crowd.</p>
          <p id="info">Gracias, Diego. The world will never forget.</p>
